### The Big Picture (Feb 5-19, 2026)

1. **Model release velocity is unprecedented.** Anthropic dropped two models in 12 days. OpenAI launched Codex-Spark minutes after Opus 4.6. Google has Gemini 3.1 Pro in the pipeline. The competitive dynamic is compressing innovation cycles to weeks, not quarters.

2. **AI coding tools are becoming AI coding agents.** The distinction between "tool that assists" and "agent that builds" is collapsing. Claude Code in GitHub Agent HQ, Cursor 2.0 with 8 parallel agents, Replit Agent doing 3-hour autonomous sessions — the paradigm shift is real.

3. **MCP is the new REST for AI.** 97M monthly SDK downloads, Linux Foundation governance, first-class support across all major platforms. If you're building any AI integrations, MCP is the protocol to build on.

4. **Voice AI is becoming EHR infrastructure.** The Speechmatics/Edvak partnership and Oracle Health's voice-first EHR signal that ambient clinical AI is moving from pilot to standard infrastructure. This validates your voice AI investment thesis.

5. **Regulation is catching up — and it's mixed news.** FDA is easing CDS/wearable oversight (good for your RPM products), but Colorado's AI law adds new compliance requirements. QMSR alignment with ISO 13485 is table stakes now. Net effect: regulatory clarity is improving but compliance surface area is growing.

6. **The local AI revolution is HIPAA-friendly.** The explosive growth of privacy-first, locally-hosted AI on GitHub (Open WebUI 124k stars, Ollama improvements, single-GPU models like Ministral 3) creates a viable path for healthcare AI that never sends PHI to cloud APIs.
