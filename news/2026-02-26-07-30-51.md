## TOP SCORER OF THE DAY

**Anthropic Vercept Acquisition + Computer Use at 72.5% OSWorld — Score: 10/10**

Why this score: Yesterday (Feb 25), Anthropic acquired Vercept, a Seattle-based computer-use AI startup ($50M raised, angel investors include Eric Schmidt and Jeff Dean), to advance Claude's ability to operate live applications — navigating spreadsheets, filling forms, managing multi-tool workflows. Claude Sonnet 4.6 now scores 72.5% on OSWorld (up from <15% in late 2024), approaching human-level performance on GUI automation tasks. UiPath stock fell 3.6% on the news — investors correctly pricing in that AI-native computer use directly threatens the $13B RPA market. Combined with Cowork Plugins GA (Feb 24), RSP v3.0 (Feb 24), and Code Security (Feb 20), Anthropic shipped four strategic moves in 5 days: enterprise agents, security scanning, safety governance, and now autonomous computer use. This is the fastest consecutive-week shipping velocity from any AI lab this year.

**What Changed:**
- **Vercept Acquisition (Feb 25)**: Anthropic acquired Vercept, a Seattle startup that built Vy — a cloud-based computer-use agent for MacOS. $50M raised. Angel investors: Eric Schmidt, Jeff Dean (Google DeepMind), Kyle Vogt (Cruise), Arash Ferdowsi (Dropbox). Team of 9, including co-founders Kiana Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick, joining Anthropic. Vercept product shuts down March 25.
- **Computer Use Performance**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 now scores 72.5% on OSWorld (GUI automation benchmark) — up from <15% in late 2024. Near-human-level on spreadsheet navigation, form filling, and multi-tab browser workflows.
- **Market Impact**: UiPath (NYSE:PATH) fell 3.6% on the news. AI-native computer use directly threatens the $13B RPA market where UiPath operates.
- **RSP v3.0 (Feb 24)**: Complete rewrite of Responsible Scaling Policy. New requirements: Frontier Safety Roadmaps (concrete safety plans) and Risk Reports (model safety profiles). Enterprise governance signal.
- **Cowork Plugins GA (Feb 24)**: 11 open-source plugins. Enterprise marketplace. Department-specific (HR, finance, legal, engineering). Google Drive, Gmail, DocuSign connectors. OpenTelemetry observability.
- **Enterprise Plugin Architecture**: Claude Agent Framework available immediately to Enterprise customers. Broader availability planned Q2 2026.

**Impact on You:**
- *Computer use for PMS*: 72.5% OSWorld means Claude can now reliably navigate clinical software GUIs — filling forms, clicking through EHR workflows, managing multi-application clinical tasks. This unlocks automated PMS workflow testing, data entry automation, and cross-system integration via GUI (not just API).
- *RPA replacement*: If using UiPath or similar RPA for clinical workflow automation, evaluate Claude computer use as a more intelligent, context-aware replacement that understands the clinical meaning of what it's automating.
- *Enterprise safety*: RSP v3.0's Risk Reports requirement means Anthropic will publish detailed safety assessments — useful for HIPAA risk analysis documentation.

**Disruption Score: 10/10** — Evaluate Claude computer use for PMS workflow automation. Study Vercept acquisition for roadmap signals. The RPA market disruption is now inevitable.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Submit HHS HTI-5 comments TODAY — deadline is tomorrow (Feb 27, 5PM ET).** Submit at [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0001). Removes 34/60 ONC cert criteria and AI model cards for CDS. This is the most impactful regulatory action of 2026.

2. **Patch n8n to version 2.5.2 immediately.** 8 high-to-critical CVEs in your automation platform. Expression evaluation and file access vulnerabilities are critical in HIPAA environments.

3. **Evaluate Claude computer use (72.5% OSWorld) for PMS workflow automation.** The Vercept acquisition signals this is a strategic priority for Anthropic. Test automated GUI navigation of clinical workflows.

4. **Run Claude Code Security against PMS codebase.** 500+ zero-days found in open-source. Enterprise/Team access available. Multi-stage verification reduces false positives.

### This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Study Google's managed MCP server architecture.** IAM integration, org/folder/project admin controls, Cloud Run hosting. Apply this governance model to your PMS MCP server design.

6. **Evaluate Gemini 3.1 Pro for clinical multi-step reasoning.** 77.1% ARC-AGI-2. 69.2% MCP Atlas (tool coordination benchmark). Compare against Opus 4.6 on PMS workflows.

7. **Read Anthropic's RSP v3.0 for compliance documentation.** Frontier Safety Roadmaps and Risk Reports provide a framework for documenting AI safety in healthcare — useful for HIPAA risk analysis.

8. **Build first PMS Cowork plugin prototype.** Fork the [knowledge-work-plugins repo](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins). Enterprise marketplace is live now.

### This Month

9. **Complete 6-model open-weight healthcare AI stack evaluation.** Qwen 3.5 (agentic) + Gemma 3 27B (multimodal) + MedGemma 1.5 (imaging) + MedASR (dictation) + Voxtral Transcribe 2 (speech) + Kimi K2.5 (vision).

10. **Prepare for Commerce Department March 11 state AI law evaluation.** Will identify "burdensome" state AI laws. Affects Texas TRAIGA and Colorado compliance roadmap.

11. **Prototype Claude computer use for PMS GUI automation testing.** The 72.5% OSWorld score means Claude can navigate spreadsheets, fill forms, and manage multi-tool workflows — exactly what clinical software requires.

12. **Study VA ambient AI scribe deployment patterns.** The largest US healthcare system targeting 170 medical centers. Their rollout playbook (10 pilot sites, phased expansion) is directly applicable to PMS deployments.

---

## MARKET CONTEXT

1. **Anthropic is executing a "full stack enterprise" strategy at unprecedented velocity.** Four strategic moves in five days: Vercept acquisition (computer use), Cowork Plugins GA (enterprise agents), RSP v3.0 (safety governance), and Code Security (vulnerability scanning). Each addresses a different enterprise objection — "can it operate my software?" (Vercept), "can it do my department's work?" (plugins), "is it safe?" (RSP), "is my code secure?" (security). No competitor has matched this breadth of simultaneous execution.

2. **Computer use is the next frontier for healthcare AI — and it's arriving faster than expected.** Claude Sonnet 4.6 at 72.5% OSWorld (from <15% in 18 months), the Vercept acquisition, and UiPath's 3.6% stock drop all signal that AI-native GUI automation will replace traditional RPA for clinical workflow automation. Healthcare, with its complex multi-application workflows and legacy EHR systems that lack APIs, may be the highest-value use case.

3. **MCP has crossed the enterprise governance threshold.** Google's managed MCP servers with IAM controls and Microsoft's API gateway governance pattern mean MCP is no longer a developer tool — it's enterprise infrastructure. 97M monthly SDK downloads and 10,000 active servers create ecosystem gravity that makes MCP the default agent-tool protocol.

4. **The VA ambient AI deployment validates healthcare AI at national scale.** The largest US healthcare system (170 medical centers, 9M+ veterans) rolling out ambient AI scribes — saving 2-3 hours daily per physician and enabling 15% more patients per hour — removes any remaining doubt about clinical AI ROI. Combined with Epic's 85% GenAI adoption, ambient AI is now standard of care, not innovation.

5. **The regulatory window narrows: HTI-5 tomorrow, Commerce Dept March 11, Colorado June 30.** Three regulatory milestones in four months. HTI-5's removal of 70% of ONC certification requirements creates the most permissive health IT regulatory environment in years. Companies that submit comments today and prepare for March/June deadlines gain first-mover advantage in reduced-burden AI deployment.
