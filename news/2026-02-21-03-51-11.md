## MARKET CONTEXT

1. **The "Sonnet is good enough" inflection has arrived.** Claude Sonnet 4.6 at 79.6% SWE-bench (within 1.2 points of Opus) and preferred over the previous flagship by 59% of developers fundamentally changes the economics of AI-powered software. For healthcare AI, this means Opus-quality clinical intelligence is now available at $3/$15 instead of $5/$25 — a 60-70% cost reduction via intelligent routing (Experiment 15) with negligible quality loss for 90%+ of tasks.

2. **Healthcare voice AI has bifurcated: transcription is table stakes, autonomous agents are the frontier.** $120M+ in funding for autonomous voice agents (Artera, Hello Patient, Tucuvi, SuperDial) in a single period, while ambient scribe is being given away free (athenaAmbient) or commoditized (Epic, Oracle). Tucuvi's EU Class IIb SaMD approval for a voice AI agent that conducts patient phone conversations is the clearest signal yet that the $3.2B voice agent market (2030) is regulatory-ready. Build agents that take action, not tools that transcribe.

3. **Three enterprise MCP gateways in one period signals protocol maturity.** Microsoft Azure APIM, Redpanda ADP, and Salesforce Agentforce all shipping MCP governance (authentication, rate-limiting, observability, policy control) within 14 days of each other. The 40+ threats from the CoSAI white paper are now addressable with commercial tooling. MCP has crossed from "promising protocol" to "enterprise infrastructure."

4. **Federal health IT deregulation is accelerating faster than regulation.** HHS HTI-5 proposes removing 50%+ of certification criteria and eliminating AI model card requirements. The Trump administration's deregulatory posture — combined with FDA's eased CDS oversight — is creating the most permissive federal environment for healthcare AI development in years. But state-level regulation (Texas TRAIGA, Colorado AI Law) is filling the gap with disclosure and transparency requirements that still require compliance.

5. **Google's Gemini 3.1 Pro at 77.1% ARC-AGI-2 is the first serious reasoning challenge to Opus 4.6.** While Opus still leads on SWE-bench coding (80.8% vs Gemini's unknown) and GPQA science (91.3%), Gemini 3.1 Pro's doubling of its predecessor's reasoning score — combined with 1M context, multimodal capability, and integration across Gemini products — means Google is no longer a distant third in the reasoning race. Monitor Gemini's coding benchmarks closely.
