## TOP SCORER OF THE DAY

**Anthropic Enterprise Blitz: Cowork Plugins GA + PowerPoint/Excel + Scheduled Tasks + Vercept — Score: 10/10**

Why this score: In 5 days (Feb 20-25), Anthropic shipped Claude in PowerPoint (Feb 20), cross-app Excel↔PowerPoint workflows (Feb 24), Cowork Plugins GA with 13 enterprise connectors and private plugin marketplaces (Feb 24), scheduled recurring tasks (Feb 26), and completed the Vercept acquisition (Feb 25). This is no longer an AI lab releasing models — it's an enterprise software company shipping a complete productivity suite. The scheduled tasks feature transforms Claude from a reactive assistant into an autonomous worker that runs analyses, updates spreadsheets, and builds presentations on a cron schedule. For healthcare, this means automated morning briefs pulling from EHR data, weekly compliance reports, and scheduled clinical quality dashboards — all without human initiation.

**What Changed:**
- **Commerce Department evaluation due March 11, 2026**: Will identify "burdensome" state AI laws. May refer laws to AI Litigation Task Force.
- **Colorado AI Act delayed to June 30, 2026**: Originally Feb 1. Governor signed SB 25B-004 delaying implementation.
- **Federal funding leverage**: $42B BEAD broadband funding conditioned on state AI regulatory compliance with federal policy.
- **Texas TRAIGA**: Active since January 1, 2026. AG enforcement. AI disclosure requirements.

**Impact on You:**
- *March 11 watch date*: Commerce Dept evaluation could identify Texas TRAIGA or Colorado CAIA as "burdensome." Federal preemption would simplify compliance, but Congressional opposition makes outcome uncertain.
- *Colorado delay = breathing room*: June 30 effective date gives 4 more months to prepare algorithmic discrimination compliance.

**Disruption Score: 7/10** — Mark March 11 for Commerce Dept evaluation. Continue Texas TRAIGA compliance. Prepare Colorado compliance by June 30.

4. **Ensure n8n is patched to latest version.** Verify all 8 CVEs are patched. Test HITL for AI tool calls on clinical automation workflows.

### This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Evaluate Gemini 3 Flash for cost-effective clinical AI workloads.** 78% SWE-bench at <25% cost of Pro. Test on clinical coding agents, FHIR resource generation, and documentation tasks.

6. **Build first PMS Cowork plugin for enterprise marketplace.** Fork plugin templates. Connect to PMS APIs. Deploy to private enterprise marketplace with admin controls.

7. **Study Epic AI Charting GA architecture.** Native ambient integration with full patient record access. Voice agent for note customization. Diagnosis-aware notes coming March. Extract design patterns for PMS.

8. **Evaluate Grok 4.1 Fast for high-volume clinical API calls.** $0.20/$0.50 per MTok is the cheapest frontier API. 2M context window. Test healthcare voice agent pronunciation.

### This Month

9. **Prototype Ministral models on Jetson Thor.** Mistral's 3B/8B/14B models specifically optimized for Jetson edge deployment. Test for clinical monitoring, patient interaction, and local inference.

10. **Prepare for Commerce Department March 11 evaluation.** Will identify "burdensome" state AI laws. May affect Texas TRAIGA compliance requirements. Monitor announcement.

## MARKET CONTEXT

1. **Anthropic has completed the transformation from AI lab to enterprise software company.** Claude in PowerPoint, Excel cross-app workflows, private plugin marketplaces, scheduled autonomous tasks, and enterprise admin controls — this is Microsoft Office AI, not a chatbot. The scheduled tasks feature is the inflection point: Claude is now an autonomous worker that executes on a schedule, not just a tool that responds to queries. No competitor offers this breadth of integrated enterprise productivity.

2. **The multi-agent IDE has arrived and it's free for existing subscribers.** VS Code 1.109 running Claude + Codex + Copilot simultaneously, each with dedicated context windows, plus Agent Skills for reusable domain expertise — the development workflow is fundamentally different from six months ago. The cost to enterprise is zero incremental (included in Copilot Business/Pro), which means adoption will be near-universal.

3. **Epic's native ambient AI launch signals the end of standalone ambient documentation as a venture category.** At 62.6% of Epic hospitals deployed and adding voice agent + nursing workflows in March, the largest EHR vendor has made ambient AI a table stakes feature, not a premium product. Standalone ambient AI startups (Ambience $243M, Suki, Abridge, Augmedix) must pivot to agentic clinical actions — autonomous order creation, care plan generation, prior authorization — or face commoditization by their EHR platform partners.

4. **MCP security governance has reached enterprise-grade maturity.** The OWASP guide (six vulnerability classes, checklist-driven), Google's IAM-integrated managed servers, and Microsoft's API gateway pattern collectively establish the security standard for production MCP deployments. Healthcare organizations now have a clear compliance pathway for MCP in HIPAA environments.

5. **The regulatory landscape is bifurcating: federal deregulation + state complexity.** HTI-5 removes 70% of ONC certification criteria while the Commerce Department evaluates state AI laws for preemption by March 11. Colorado delayed to June 30. Texas TRAIGA active. The net effect is less federal certification burden but persistent state compliance complexity — until the March 11 evaluation clarifies federal intent.
