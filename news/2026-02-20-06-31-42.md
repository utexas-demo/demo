## TOP SCORER OF THE DAY

**Anthropic $30B Series G + Claude Ecosystem Dominance — Score: 10/10**

Why this score: Anthropic raised $30 billion in Series G funding at a $380 billion post-money valuation (Feb 12) — the second-largest VC deal of all time. Run-rate revenue is $14 billion (10x annual growth for three consecutive years). Claude Code alone has a $2.5B+ run-rate, more than doubling since January. Meanwhile, Opus 4.6 discovered 500+ previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities in open-source software (GhostScript, OpenSC, CGIF), Anthropic partnered with the Allen Institute and HHMI for life-science AI agents, Notion made Opus 4.6 its default AI (Feb 9), and "The Briefing" enterprise agents event is 4 days away (Feb 24). This isn't just a funding round — it's the convergence of financial dominance, technical leadership, and ecosystem lock-in that makes Anthropic the most consequential AI company for your stack.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Submit HHS AI RFI comments by February 23.** Federal RFI on accelerating AI in clinical care. Three days left. Covers regulation, reimbursement, and R&D. Submit at [regulations.gov (HHS-ONC-2026-0001)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/23/2025-23641/request-for-information-accelerating-the-adoption-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence-as-part-of).

2. **Register and attend Anthropic "The Briefing" (Feb 24).** Enterprise agents, Cowork demos, security/governance sessions, 1:1 with Anthropic team. 4 days away. [Register here](https://www.anthropic.com/events/the-briefing-enterprise-agents).

3. **Run Opus 4.6 zero-day scanning against your open-source dependencies.** 500+ zero-days found in libraries like GhostScript that had been fuzzed for years. Point it at your healthcare software's dependency tree.

4. **Evaluate Claude Sonnet 4.6 for production API.** SWE-bench 79.6%, OSWorld 72.5% at $3/$15 per 1M tokens. Run healthcare NLP benchmarks this week.

### This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Evaluate Gemma 3 27B for on-premise healthcare NLP.** Multimodal (text + image), 128K context, 140+ languages, single GPU. Best open model for HIPAA-compliant on-premise deployment.

6. **Test Gemma 3n for RPM edge devices.** 2-4GB memory footprint via Per-Layer Embeddings. 1.5x faster on mobile. MatFormer allows running smaller sub-models when resources are constrained.

7. **Implement MCP gateway.** Choose Microsoft Azure APIM or Redpanda ADP. Both provide centralized authentication, rate-limiting, and audit logging for MCP servers. Addresses the 40+ threats identified in the CoSAI white paper.

8. **Enable Claude Code agent teams.** Add `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`. Test multi-agent coordination on a non-critical feature branch.

### This Month

9. **Evaluate Speechmatics Medical Model** for voice AI pipeline. 93% real-time accuracy, 96% medical keyword recall.

10. **Prototype context compaction for long-running clinical agents.** The new API enables "infinite" conversation history by automatically summarizing older segments. Build a POC for extended patient interaction agents.

11. **Research autonomous voice agent market.** Study VoiceCare AI, Secai/Voxira, SuperDial architectures. The $3.2B market projection (2030) centers on agents that make phone calls and handle tasks — not transcription, which is being commoditized.

12. **Prepare Colorado AI Law compliance (June 30 deadline).** Begin impact assessment documentation for AI systems making consequential healthcare decisions.

## MARKET CONTEXT

1. **Anthropic has reached escape velocity.** $30B Series G at $380B valuation, $14B run-rate revenue, Claude Code at $2.5B ARR, 500+ zero-day discoveries, Allen/HHMI life science partnerships, Notion default AI, and an enterprise agents event in 4 days. The question is no longer "should we bet on Claude" — it's "how deeply do we integrate." For healthcare AI, this means Claude is now the safest long-term bet for your primary AI infrastructure.

2. **Ambient clinical documentation has been commoditized.** Epic at ~$80/mo and athenahealth free mean ambient scribe is table stakes, not a differentiator. The $1B+ standalone scribe market (Abridge, Ambience, Nabla) faces existential platform risk. The growth frontier has shifted to **autonomous voice agents** — AI that makes phone calls, handles prior auth, processes claims, and manages patient communication (VoiceCare AI, Secai/Voxira, SuperDial). This is a $3.2B market by 2030.

3. **On-device AI is suddenly viable for healthcare.** Google's Gemma 3n running with 2-4GB memory via Per-Layer Embeddings and MatFormer architecture makes on-device clinical AI practical for the first time. Combined with NVIDIA's 35% inference speedup, this opens the door to RPM edge devices that run real AI models locally — no cloud required, no PHI transmission.

4. **MCP governance hit enterprise-grade in one week.** Microsoft Azure APIM and Redpanda ADP both shipping MCP governance (authentication, rate-limiting, audit logging, policy control) in the same week signals that MCP has crossed the enterprise adoption threshold. The 40+ threats in the CoSAI white paper are now addressable with commercial tooling.

5. **The federal AI policy window is open — and closing.** HHS RFI comments due Feb 23 (3 days), Trump AI EO attempting to preempt state regulation, HHS nixed Biden-era AI model cards, FDA easing CDS oversight. The regulatory landscape is being reshaped right now. If you don't submit RFI comments, someone else defines what "AI in clinical care" means for federal policy.
