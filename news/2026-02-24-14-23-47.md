## TOP SCORER OF THE DAY

**Anthropic "The Briefing" + Cowork Enterprise Plugins GA — Score: 10/10**

Why this score: Today (Feb 24), Anthropic held "The Briefing: Enterprise Agents" virtual event and simultaneously shipped Cowork plugins to production with 11 open-source plugins, private enterprise plugin marketplaces, connectors for Google Drive, Gmail, DocuSign, FactSet, and LegalZoom, plus OpenTelemetry observability. This follows the Jan 30 Cowork plugins research preview that triggered the "$285B SaaSpocalypse" — a 48-hour selloff in global software stocks (Thomson Reuters -16%, LegalZoom -20%, FactSet -10%, RELX -14%). Today's GA launch doubles down with department-specific plugins for HR, finance, legal, engineering, design, investment banking, and equity research, plus admin controls for private plugin marketplaces. Combined with Claude Code Security (Feb 20, 500+ zero-days), self-serve Enterprise (Feb 12), and agent teams — Anthropic is now shipping enterprise-grade AI agents at a pace no competitor matches.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Submit HHS HTI-5 comments by February 27 (3 days).** Removes 34/60 ONC certification criteria. Eliminates AI model cards for CDS. This is the single most impactful regulatory comment window of 2026.

2. **Fork and study the [Anthropic knowledge-work-plugins repo](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins).** Today's Cowork plugins GA includes the open-source plugin architecture. Build healthcare-specific plugins for PMS workflows.

3. **Purchase self-serve Claude Enterprise plan.** Bundles Claude + Code + Cowork. Contact sales separately for HIPAA BAA. Adopt agent teams for parallel PMS development.

4. **Enable GitHub Agent HQ for your development team.** Run Claude, Codex, and Copilot side by side in VS Code. Assign best agent per task. Included with existing Copilot Pro+/Enterprise.

### This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Evaluate Gemini 3 Deep Think via API for complex clinical reasoning.** 84.6% ARC-AGI-2. Solved 18 unsolved research problems. Test on complex diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning.

6. **Evaluate Kimi K2.5 for on-premise multimodal/vision workflows.** 1T param open-weight. Top vision benchmarks. Agent Swarm architecture. $0.60/M tokens API or self-hosted.

7. **Study Oracle Health's ambient-to-order pipeline.** Their Clinical AI Agent now auto-creates orders from voice. This is the reference architecture for clinical AI agents moving beyond documentation.

8. **Pivot voice AI strategy from documentation to autonomous action.** Epic AI Charting (native, 42% market) + athenaAmbient (free) have commoditized ambient documentation. Value is now in order creation, care plans, and clinical action.

### This Month

9. **Prototype complete 5-model open-weight healthcare AI stack.** Qwen 3.5 (coding) + Gemma 3 27B (multimodal) + MedGemma 1.5 (clinical) + Voxtral Transcribe 2 (speech) + Kimi K2.5 (vision). All local, all HIPAA-compliant.

10. **Build PMS Cowork plugin prototype.** Use Anthropic's plugin architecture to create healthcare-specific Cowork plugins — clinical documentation, order management, patient communication, compliance reporting.

11. **Prepare Colorado AI Act compliance (June 30 deadline).** Federal preemption uncertain. Begin impact assessment assuming enforcement proceeds.

12. **Apply ArXiv healthcare AI taxonomy to PMS agent design.** Use the 7-dimensional evaluation framework (capability, safety, governance, interoperability, equity, explainability, clinical validation) as the acceptance criteria for clinical AI features.

---

## MARKET CONTEXT

1. **Enterprise AI agents are now shipping to production, not just demoing.** Anthropic's Cowork plugins moved from research preview to GA with private marketplaces, OpenTelemetry observability, and department-specific plugins in less than 30 days. The $285B SaaSpocalypse wasn't a false alarm — it was the market correctly pricing in that AI agents are replacing SaaS workflows, and today's GA launch confirms the trajectory.

2. **Ambient clinical documentation is fully commoditized — the era of clinical AI agents begins.** Epic AI Charting (native, 42% market share), athenaAmbient (free), and Oracle Health Clinical AI Agent (order creation) mark the end of documentation as a differentiator. The $243M Ambience Healthcare raise and $50M Voize raise are the last documentation-era mega-rounds. Future healthcare AI value accrues to systems that take autonomous clinical action — orders, referrals, care plans.

3. **The open-weight model ecosystem now matches proprietary quality across every modality.** Kimi K2.5 (vision, beats GPT-5.2 on 9/17 benchmarks), Qwen 3.5 (coding, overtook Llama), Voxtral Transcribe 2 (speech, Apache 2.0), MedGemma 1.5 (clinical), Gemma 3 27B (multimodal) — a complete 5-model healthcare AI stack is deployable on-premise today. GGML.ai joining Hugging Face consolidates the deployment toolchain.

4. **AI coding tools have converged on multi-agent parallel execution as the default architecture.** Claude Code agent teams, Codex App multi-agent, GitHub Agent HQ (three agents in one IDE), Cursor 8-worker parallel, Windsurf parallel sessions — every tool now supports the same pattern. The differentiation has shifted from "can it do multi-agent?" to toolchain integration, security scanning, and enterprise governance.

5. **The regulatory window remains open but state-level enforcement is real.** HTI-5 proposes removing 70% of ONC certification requirements (3 days to comment). Texas TRAIGA is actively enforcing AI disclosure requirements. Colorado's June 30 deadline approaches. The federal deregulatory posture and state-level enforcement create a compliance landscape that rewards companies who build compliant by default rather than retrofitting.
