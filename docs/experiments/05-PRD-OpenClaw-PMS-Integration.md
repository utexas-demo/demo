# Product Requirements Document: OpenClaw Integration into Practice Management System (PMS)

**Document ID:** PRD-PMS-OPENCLAW-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Author:** Ammar (CEO, MPS Inc.)
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD defines the integration of OpenClaw — an open-source agentic AI gateway — into the MPS Inc. Practice Management System (PMS). The goal is to deploy a locally-hosted autonomous agent that automates repetitive clinical and administrative workflows: prior authorization processing, care coordination follow-ups, clinical documentation drafting, and cross-system data reconciliation.

OpenClaw will be **self-hosted on MPS infrastructure** inside Docker with a hardened security envelope to maintain HIPAA compliance. No PHI will leave our network boundary. All agent actions that modify data will require human-in-the-loop approval.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

The current PMS workflow has several operational bottlenecks:

- **Manual prior authorization:** Staff spend 15-30 minutes per authorization request gathering clinical data, checking payer policies, and drafting letters. With 200+ requests per week across practices, this is a major time sink.
- **Fragmented care coordination:** Health coaches manage follow-ups across multiple systems (EHR, scheduling, messaging). Tasks fall through the cracks when handoffs are manual.
- **Repetitive documentation:** Clinical notes, encounter summaries, and status update emails follow predictable templates but are still drafted manually for each patient.
- **Cross-system reconciliation:** Device readings (RPM), engagement scores, and encounter records live in separate data warehouse collections. Correlating data across systems for a single patient requires manual queries.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

Deploy OpenClaw as a **task automation agent** accessible to PMS users via a web-based chat interface and scheduled background workflows. OpenClaw's skills architecture connects to our existing FastAPI backend, data warehouse, and third-party integrations (fax, payer portals) to execute multi-step workflows autonomously.

### 3.2 Deployment Model

- **Self-hosted OpenClaw** running in Docker on MPS infrastructure with sandboxed execution
- **LLM provider:** Anthropic Claude API (API key in environment variables; agent queries contain task descriptions and schema metadata only — no raw PHI)
- **Skills:** Custom PMS skills call the FastAPI backend internally via authenticated API; all PHI stays within the network boundary
- **Human-in-the-loop:** All write operations (creating records, sending messages, submitting authorizations) require explicit user approval before execution

---

## 6. Scheduled Workflows

Beyond interactive chat, OpenClaw will run scheduled background tasks:

| Workflow | Schedule | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Morning follow-up list | Daily 7:00 AM | Identify patients needing follow-up, draft outreach plan |
| Prior auth queue check | Every 2 hours | Check pending authorizations, flag items needing attention |
| Device compliance scan | Daily 8:00 PM | Identify devices not reporting in 24+ hours |
| Weekly metrics digest | Monday 6:00 AM | Generate practice performance summary for account managers |

All scheduled workflows produce reports that require human review before any outbound actions.

---

## 7. User Roles and Access

| Role | Skill Access | Approval Authority |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Practice Administrator** | All skills, own practice data | Approve outreach, view reports |
| **Health Coach** | Patient lookup, encounters, care coordination | Approve patient communications |
| **Prior Auth Specialist** | Patient lookup, prior auth, document draft | Approve authorization submissions |
| **Account Manager** | Reports, device reconciliation | View-only, no write actions |
| **MPS Admin** | All skills, all practices | Full approval authority |

Access control is enforced at the FastAPI layer via JWT-based RBAC. OpenClaw passes the user's authentication token with every skill invocation.

---

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

### 8.1 Security and HIPAA Compliance

**Critical:** OpenClaw's default configuration is NOT HIPAA-compliant. The following hardening measures are mandatory:

- **Network isolation:** OpenClaw Docker container runs inside MPS's private network; no inbound ports exposed to the internet
- **Authentication:** OpenClaw web UI protected by MPS's existing SSO/JWT authentication; no anonymous access
- **PHI isolation:** Agent queries to the LLM contain only task descriptions and field schemas — never raw patient data. All PHI stays within PMS API calls inside the network
- **Sandboxed execution:** Docker container runs with minimal privileges; filesystem access restricted to designated working directory
- **Skill governance:** Only vetted, internally-developed skills are installed. ClawHub (public skill marketplace) is disabled. No autonomous skill installation
- **Audit logging:** Every agent action (skill invocation, data access, document generation) logged with timestamp, user ID, patient ID, and action type
- **Human-in-the-loop:** All write operations require explicit user approval. Agent cannot autonomously modify patient records, send communications, or submit authorizations
- **Access tiering:** Three privilege levels — read-only (query data), write-advisory (draft documents for review), write-autonomous (disabled for PHI-related operations)

### 8.2 Performance

- Agent response time < 5 seconds for simple queries (patient lookup, encounter search)
- Complex workflows (prior auth drafting) < 30 seconds
- Scheduled workflows complete within 10 minutes
- Concurrent user support: 10 simultaneous agent sessions

### 8.3 Infrastructure

- Docker-based deployment with `docker-compose.yml`
- Node.js runtime within container
- Persistent memory stored in mounted volume (Markdown files)
- Anthropic Claude API key in environment variables
- Compatible with existing MPS CI/CD pipeline

---

## 10. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Prior auth processing time | 50% reduction (15 min → 7 min) | Average time from request to submission |
| Follow-up completion rate | 30% improvement | Percentage of overdue follow-ups resolved within 48 hours |
| Clinical document drafting | 60% reduction in manual effort | Time spent on encounter summaries and referral letters |
| Agent accuracy | > 90% of drafted documents accepted without major edits | Approval rate tracking |
| User adoption | 50% of eligible staff within 3 months | Active user tracking |

---

## 11. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM hallucination in clinical documents | Critical | Human-in-the-loop review mandatory for all clinical content; agent marks confidence level on each draft |
| Security vulnerability in OpenClaw (3 CVEs in first 90 days) | Critical | Pinned version with security patches; network isolation; disable ClawHub; regular security audits |
| PHI leakage to LLM provider | Critical | Architectural enforcement: skills return data to agent locally, agent generates summaries without raw PHI in LLM prompts |
| Shadow IT — staff running personal OpenClaw instances | High | IT policy prohibiting unauthorized installations; provide official sanctioned instance with proper controls |
| Agent takes unauthorized action | High | Write-autonomous mode disabled for PHI operations; all modifications require human approval |
| Increased API load from agent workflows | Medium | Rate limiting on skills; caching for frequently accessed data; separate API rate tier for agent |
