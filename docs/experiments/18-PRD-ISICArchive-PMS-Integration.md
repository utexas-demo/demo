# Product Requirements Document: ISIC Archive Integration into Patient Management System (PMS)

**Document ID:** PRD-PMS-ISICARCHIVE-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Author:** Ammar (CEO, MPS Inc.)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

The ISIC Archive (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) is the world's largest open-access repository of dermoscopic skin lesion images, maintained by a global academia-industry partnership with the mission of reducing skin cancer mortality through digital imaging and artificial intelligence. The archive contains over 400,000 expert-annotated dermoscopic images spanning nine diagnostic categories — melanoma, melanocytic nevi, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, benign keratosis, dermatofibroma, vascular lesions, and others — with rich metadata including diagnosis, anatomical site, age, sex, and imaging modality. Data is freely available under Creative Commons licenses via a REST API, the `isic-cli` command-line tool, and an AWS Open Data S3 bucket.

Integrating the ISIC Archive into the PMS enables **AI-assisted skin lesion triage** directly within the clinical encounter workflow. When a clinician captures a dermoscopic image of a patient's skin lesion (via the Android app, a USB dermoscope, or an uploaded photo), the PMS can classify the lesion against ISIC-trained deep learning models, retrieve visually similar reference images from the archive for comparison, and generate a structured risk assessment — all within seconds. This transforms the PMS from a passive record-keeping system into an active clinical decision support tool for dermatology, helping primary care providers identify lesions that warrant specialist referral.

The ISIC dataset's role as the benchmark standard for the annual ISIC Challenge (3,400+ participants in 2024, hosted on Kaggle) means that a rich ecosystem of pre-trained models exists. For the PMS, this means deploying proven classification models (EfficientNet, MobileNet, ConvNeXtV2) locally on the Jetson Thor edge device or as a containerized inference service — keeping patient images on-premises for HIPAA compliance while leveraging the collective research of thousands of AI researchers.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current PMS has no dermatology-specific clinical decision support, creating gaps in skin lesion assessment workflows:

- **No image-based CDS for skin lesions:** Primary care clinicians frequently encounter suspicious skin lesions during routine exams but lack the diagnostic confidence of a dermatologist. The PMS captures encounter notes but has no mechanism to analyze a dermoscopic image and provide a risk assessment. Clinicians must rely on visual inspection alone (60% accuracy) or refer every suspicious lesion to a dermatologist, creating bottlenecks.
- **No reference image database:** When evaluating a lesion, clinicians benefit from comparing it to confirmed examples. The PMS has no library of reference dermoscopic images to support visual pattern matching — clinicians must search external resources or rely on memory.
- **Delayed specialist referrals:** Without automated triage, low-risk lesions are unnecessarily referred to dermatology (wasting specialist capacity), while high-risk lesions may be missed or deprioritized. There is no structured risk scoring to guide referral urgency.
- **No lesion tracking over time:** Patients with multiple moles or prior skin cancer history need longitudinal monitoring. The PMS cannot compare a current lesion image against prior images to detect changes in size, shape, or color over time.
- **Disconnected from AI research ecosystem:** The ISIC Challenge produces state-of-the-art classification models annually, but the PMS has no pipeline to deploy and update these models. New research advances in skin cancer detection remain inaccessible to PMS clinicians.

## 3. Proposed Solution

Build an **ISIC-Powered Dermatology CDS Module** in the PMS that combines ISIC Archive reference data with on-premises AI inference for skin lesion classification, similarity search, and longitudinal tracking.

### 3.2 Deployment Model

- **Self-hosted inference:** AI classification runs on-premises within the Docker stack as the `pms-derm-cds` service, ensuring no patient images leave the network. Model weights are downloaded once from public repositories and cached locally.
- **Edge inference option:** For the Android app and Jetson Thor edge device, a TensorFlow Lite / ONNX model provides on-device inference without network dependency, enabling offline skin lesion triage.
- **ISIC reference data cached locally:** A curated subset of ISIC reference images (10,000-50,000 representative examples) is cached in the PMS with pre-computed embeddings for similarity search. Full archive access remains available via the ISIC API for extended searches.
- **HIPAA security envelope:** Patient dermoscopic images are stored encrypted in PostgreSQL (AES-256), never transmitted to external services. Only de-identified embeddings are compared against the ISIC reference dataset. Audit logging tracks every image upload and classification request.
- **Docker container:** Single `pms-derm-cds` container with PyTorch/ONNX Runtime, pre-loaded model weights, and ISIC reference cache.

## 8. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|---|---|---|
| Classification accuracy (top-1) | > 85% on ISIC test set | Automated evaluation against held-out labeled data |
| Classification accuracy (top-3) | > 95% (correct diagnosis in top 3) | Same as above |
| Triage sensitivity (melanoma) | > 95% (miss rate < 5%) | Clinician-confirmed outcomes vs AI predictions |
| Unnecessary referral reduction | 30% fewer low-risk referrals | Referral count comparison pre/post deployment |

---

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| AI classification error leading to missed melanoma | Critical — patient safety | Use AI as **decision support**, not autonomous diagnosis; always require clinician review; set high-sensitivity thresholds that over-refer rather than under-refer |
| Class imbalance in training data (rare cancers underrepresented) | High — poor accuracy on rare lesions | Use ISIC Challenge models that address imbalance (oversampling, focal loss); clearly indicate confidence levels |
| Image quality variation (lighting, focus, camera differences) | Medium — degraded accuracy | Add image quality checks on upload (blur detection, exposure assessment); provide capture guidelines |
| Patient anxiety from AI results | Medium — misinterpretation of risk scores | Never show raw AI output to patients; present results only to clinicians with context and uncertainty estimates |
| Model drift over time as image distribution changes | Low — gradual accuracy decline | Annual model refresh from ISIC Challenge; monitor classification confidence distribution for drift |
| ISIC Archive data licensing changes | Low — reference cache availability | Cache data locally; CC licenses are irrevocable for already-downloaded data |
| GPU unavailability in deployment environment | Medium — slow inference | ONNX Runtime CPU fallback; quantized INT8 models reduce CPU inference time |

## 11. Comparison with Existing Experiments

| Aspect | ISIC Archive (This Experiment) | Gemma 3 (Experiment 13) | Vision Capabilities (Edge) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary purpose** | Skin lesion classification and dermatology CDS | General clinical AI (summarization, extraction, medication intelligence) | Wound assessment, patient ID, document OCR |
| **AI model type** | Specialized CNN (EfficientNet/MobileNet trained on dermoscopy) | General-purpose LLM (multimodal) | Computer vision (object detection, OCR) |
| **Image domain** | Dermoscopic skin lesion images | Clinical notes, medication images | Wound photos, ID cards, documents |
| **Data source** | ISIC Archive (400K+ labeled images, public) | None (model is pre-trained) | Live camera feed |
| **Inference location** | On-premises Docker, Jetson edge, Android on-device | On-premises via Ollama | Jetson Thor edge device |
| **Complementarity** | ISIC handles dermoscopy-specific classification using specialized domain models. Gemma 3 can provide contextual clinical reasoning about ISIC classification results (e.g., "given this patient's history and the ISIC classification, what are the next steps?"). Vision capabilities handle non-dermoscopic imaging. | Gemma 3 provides general medical reasoning but lacks the 400K+ labeled dermoscopy training images that make ISIC models superior for skin lesion classification. | Edge vision handles wound assessment; ISIC handles dermoscopic lesion classification — different image domains and clinical workflows. |

ISIC integration is complementary to both Gemma 3 and Vision capabilities: ISIC provides domain-specific skin lesion expertise that general-purpose models cannot match, while Gemma 3 provides clinical reasoning about the results, and Vision handles non-dermoscopic imaging tasks.
