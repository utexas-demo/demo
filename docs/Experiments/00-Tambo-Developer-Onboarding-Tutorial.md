## Part 1: Understanding Tambo (15 min read)

### 1.1 What Problem Does Tambo Solve?

Today, our PMS stakeholders (practice admins, health coaches, account managers) get a static weekly PDF report. If they want to ask "which patients missed their RPM check-in last week?" they have to email engineering and wait for a custom query.

Tambo lets us build a **chat sidebar** where users type questions in plain English and get back **real React components** — charts, tables, dashboards — populated with live data from our APIs. The AI agent decides which component to show based on the question.

### 1.2 How Tambo Works — The Three Pieces

Think of Tambo as a translator sitting between a user's question and your React components.

```
USER QUESTION                    TAMBO AGENT                     YOUR CODE
─────────────                    ───────────                     ─────────
"Show me enrollment              Thinks: "This is about          Calls queryPatientStatus()
 for Dr. Smith's                 enrollment metrics.             → hits Spring Boot API
 practice"                       I should use the                → returns data
                                 EnrollmentDashboard             
                                 component and call              Renders <EnrollmentDashboard>
                                 queryPatientStatus              with the API data as props
                                 to get data."                   
                                                                 User sees a live chart
```

**The three things you define:**

| You Build | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Components** | React components with a Zod schema describing their props | `EnrollmentDashboard`, `EncounterTable` |
| **Tools** | Functions that fetch data (usually API calls) | `queryPatientStatus()` → calls Spring Boot |
| **Descriptions** | Text that tells the AI when to use each component/tool | "Use this when the user asks about enrollment rates" |

The AI reads your descriptions and schemas, decides what to call, and Tambo streams the result into your component.

### 1.3 Key Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Generative component** | A component rendered once in response to a message (charts, tables, summaries) |
| **Interactable component** | A component that persists and updates across messages (task boards, forms) |
| **TamboProvider** | The React context wrapper that connects your app to the Tambo backend |
| **Thread** | A conversation (list of messages). Each message can have text and/or a rendered component |
| **Tool** | A function the AI agent can call to get data or perform actions |
| **Zod schema** | A TypeScript-first schema declaration that defines the shape of your component props |
| **Context helper** | Extra info you pass to the AI (current page, user role, selected org) |

## Part 2: Environment Setup (30 min)

### 2.1 Prerequisites Checklist

Before you start, confirm you have everything installed. Open a terminal and run each command:

```bash
node --version
# Need: v22.x.x or higher
# If not: nvm install 22 && nvm use 22

npm --version
# Need: 11.x.x or higher

docker --version
# Need: 24.x or higher

docker compose version
# Need: v2.x or higher

git --version
# Need: 2.x or higher
```

If any of these fail, install the missing tool before continuing. Ask the team lead for help if needed.

### 2.2 Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the PMS frontend repo (which already includes Tambo integration)
cd ~/projects
git clone git@github.com:utexas-demo/pms-frontend.git
cd pms-frontend

# Switch to the tambo-integration branch
git checkout feature/tambo-pms-integration

# Install dependencies (this includes @tambo-ai/react and zod)
npm install
```

### 2.3 Start the Backend Services

You need three services running. Open three terminal tabs:

**Terminal 1 — Tambo Database (PostgreSQL)**

```bash
cd ~/projects/tambo
docker compose --env-file docker.env up postgres -d

# Verify it started
docker ps | grep postgres
# You should see a running container
```

**Terminal 2 — Tambo Backend (API + Dashboard)**

```bash
cd ~/projects/tambo
npm run dev:cloud

# Wait for output like:
#   ✓ API ready on http://localhost:3001
#   ✓ Web ready on http://localhost:3000
```

**Terminal 3 — MPS Spring Boot API**

```bash
cd ~/projects/pms-backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Wait for:
#   Started MPSApiApplication in X seconds
#   Listening on http://localhost:8080
```

### 2.4 Configure Your Environment

Copy the example env file and fill in your values:

```bash
cd ~/projects/pms-frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# Tambo self-hosted backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY=ask_team_lead_for_shared_dev_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# MPS backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_PMS_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

If you need to generate your own Tambo API key:

1. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Log in (or create an account on the local instance)
3. Open the "MPS PMS" project
4. Go to Settings → API Keys → Generate
5. Paste the key into your `.env.local`

### 2.5 Start the Frontend

```bash
cd ~/projects/pms-frontend
npm run dev

# Opens at http://localhost:3030
```

### 2.6 Verify Everything Works

Open http://localhost:3030/dashboard in your browser. You should see the PMS dashboard with an **Analytics Sidebar** on the right side. Type "hello" and press Enter. If you get a text response from the AI, your setup is working.

**Checkpoint:** All four services running, sidebar responding to messages.

---

## Part 3: Build Your First Component (45 min)

Let's build a simple component from scratch so you understand every piece.

### 3.1 What We Are Building

A **NoShowAlert** component that displays a list of patients who missed their appointments today, with a count and urgency indicator. The user will trigger it by asking something like "Who were my no-shows today?"

### 3.2 Step 1 — Create the React Component

Create `src/components/tambo-pms/no-show-alert.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

interface NoShowPatient {
  name: string;
  appointmentTime: string;
  encounterType: string;
  healthCoach: string;
  phone: string;
}

interface NoShowAlertProps {
  date?: string;
  patients?: NoShowPatient[];
  totalScheduled?: number;
}

export default function NoShowAlert({
  date = "Today",
  patients = [],
  totalScheduled = 0,
}: NoShowAlertProps) {
  const noShowCount = patients.length;
  const noShowRate = totalScheduled > 0
    ? ((noShowCount / totalScheduled) * 100).toFixed(1)
    : "0.0";

  // Color coding based on severity
  const severity =
    noShowCount === 0 ? "green" :
    noShowCount <= 3 ? "yellow" : "red";

  const severityStyles = {
    green:  { bg: "bg-green-50",  border: "border-green-200", text: "text-green-800",  badge: "bg-green-100" },
    yellow: { bg: "bg-amber-50",  border: "border-amber-200", text: "text-amber-800",  badge: "bg-amber-100" },
    red:    { bg: "bg-red-50",    border: "border-red-200",   text: "text-red-800",    badge: "bg-red-100" },
  };

  const s = severityStyles[severity];

  return (
    <div className={`rounded-xl border ${s.border} ${s.bg} p-5 max-w-md`}>
      {/* Header */}
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-3">
        <h3 className={`text-sm font-semibold ${s.text}`}>No-Shows — {date}</h3>
        <span className={`text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded-full ${s.badge} ${s.text} font-medium`}>
          {noShowCount} of {totalScheduled} ({noShowRate}%)
        </span>
      </div>

      {/* Patient List */}
      {patients.length === 0 ? (
        <p className="text-sm text-green-600">No missed appointments. Great day!</p>
      ) : (
        <ul className="space-y-3">
          {patients.map((patient, i) => (
            <li key={i} className="bg-white rounded-lg p-3 shadow-sm">
              <div className="flex justify-between items-start">
                <div>
                  <p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">{patient.name}</p>
                  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
                    {patient.encounterType} at {patient.appointmentTime}
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-xs text-gray-400">Coach: {patient.healthCoach}</p>
                </div>
                <span className="text-xs text-blue-600 font-mono">{patient.phone}</span>
              </div>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is just a normal React component. Nothing Tambo-specific yet. You could render it anywhere with hardcoded props. Save the file.

### 3.3 Step 2 — Define the Zod Schema

The Zod schema tells Tambo what props your component accepts. The agent reads this schema to understand what data it needs to provide.

Open `src/lib/pms-tambo.ts` and add your component to the `pmsComponents` array:

```typescript
// Add this import at the top
import NoShowAlert from "@/components/tambo-pms/no-show-alert";

// Add this entry to the pmsComponents array
{
  name: "NoShowAlert",
  description:
    "Displays patients who missed their appointments (no-shows) for a given " +
    "day. Shows patient names, appointment times, encounter types, and contact " +
    "info. Includes severity color coding based on no-show count. Use this " +
    "when the user asks about no-shows, missed appointments, or patients who " +
    "didn't show up.",
  component: NoShowAlert,
  propsSchema: z.object({
    date: z.string().describe("The date being reported, e.g. 'February 16, 2026'"),
    patients: z.array(z.object({
      name: z.string().describe("Patient full name"),
      appointmentTime: z.string().describe("Scheduled time, e.g. '9:00 AM'"),
      encounterType: z.string().describe("Type: RPM, CCM, HRA, or APPOINTMENT"),
      healthCoach: z.string().describe("Assigned health coach name"),
      phone: z.string().describe("Patient phone number for follow-up"),
    })).describe("List of patients who no-showed"),
    totalScheduled: z.number().describe("Total appointments scheduled for the day"),
  }),
},
```

**Why descriptions matter:** The `.describe()` calls are not just documentation — the AI reads them to understand what each field means. Better descriptions lead to more accurate component rendering.

### 3.4 Step 3 — Test It

Save your files and let hot reload pick up the changes. Go to the Analytics Sidebar and type:

> "Who were the no-shows today?"

The agent should render your `NoShowAlert` component. Since we haven't connected a real API tool yet, the agent will generate sample data based on your schema descriptions.

**What just happened:**

1. Your message went to the Tambo backend
2. The backend sent it to the LLM with your component schemas
3. The LLM decided `NoShowAlert` was the right component
4. The LLM generated props matching your Zod schema
5. Tambo streamed those props to your React component
6. Your component rendered in the sidebar

---

## Part 4: Build Your First Tool (30 min)

Components render the UI, but **tools** provide the real data. Right now the AI is making up sample data. Let's connect it to our actual API.

### 4.1 What a Tool Does

A tool is a function that the AI agent can call. When a user asks "Who were the no-shows today?", the agent will:

1. Decide it needs no-show data → call the `getNoShows` tool
2. The tool hits the Spring Boot API → returns real patient data
3. The agent feeds that data into the `NoShowAlert` component props

### 4.2 Create the Tool

Open `src/lib/pms-tools.ts` and add:

```typescript
{
  name: "getNoShows",
  description:
    "Fetches the list of patients who no-showed (missed their appointment) " +
    "for a given date and organization. Returns patient names, scheduled times, " +
    "encounter types, health coach assignments, and contact info. Also returns " +
    "the total number of appointments scheduled that day for rate calculation.",
  tool: async (params: { organizationId: string; date: string }) => {
    const { organizationId, date } = params;
    const response = await pmsFetch(
      `/api/dw/events?orgId=${organizationId}&date=${date}&outcome=NO_SHOW`
    );

    // Transform the API response to match what the component expects
    return {
      date: new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
        weekday: "long",
        year: "numeric",
        month: "long",
        day: "numeric",
      }),
      patients: response.encounters.map((enc: any) => ({
        name: enc.patientName,
        appointmentTime: new Date(enc.scheduledDate).toLocaleTimeString("en-US", {
          hour: "numeric",
          minute: "2-digit",
        }),
        encounterType: enc.encounterType,
        healthCoach: enc.healthCoach,
        phone: enc.patientPhone || "N/A",
      })),
      totalScheduled: response.summary.total,
    };
  },
  inputSchema: z.object({
    organizationId: z.string().describe("The practice/organization ID"),
    date: z.string().describe("Date to check in YYYY-MM-DD format"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    date: z.string(),
    patients: z.array(z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      appointmentTime: z.string(),
      encounterType: z.string(),
      healthCoach: z.string(),
      phone: z.string(),
    })),
    totalScheduled: z.number(),
  }),
},
```

### 4.3 Test with Real Data

Save the file and go back to the sidebar. Type:

> "Show me today's no-shows"

This time the agent should:
1. Call `listOrganizations` to get available orgs (from your context or the tool)
2. Call `getNoShows` with today's date
3. Render `NoShowAlert` with real patient data from your Spring Boot API

Check your browser's Network tab to see the actual API call being made to `localhost:8080`.

### 4.4 Testing Tip — Mock Data Fallback

If the Spring Boot API doesn't have the exact endpoint yet, you can temporarily return mock data from your tool:

```typescript
tool: async (params: { organizationId: string; date: string }) => {
  // TODO: Replace with real API call once endpoint is ready
  return {
    date: "February 16, 2026",
    patients: [
      {
        name: "Jane Doe",
        appointmentTime: "9:00 AM",
        encounterType: "RPM",
        healthCoach: "Sarah Johnson",
        phone: "(555) 123-4567",
      },
      {
        name: "John Smith",
        appointmentTime: "10:30 AM",
        encounterType: "CCM",
        healthCoach: "Sarah Johnson",
        phone: "(555) 987-6543",
      },
    ],
    totalScheduled: 12,
  };
},
```

This lets you develop and test the UI without waiting for backend changes.

## Part 5: Debugging Common Issues (15 min read)

### 5.1 "The agent shows text instead of my component"

This usually means the agent couldn't match your query to a component.

**Fixes:**
- Make your component `description` more specific and cover more phrasings
- Add keywords the user might use: "no-shows", "missed", "didn't show up", "absent"
- Check that your component is included in the `pmsComponents` array in `pms-tambo.ts`
- Restart the dev server after changes to the component registry

### 5.2 "The component renders but with wrong/empty data"

**Fixes:**
- Check the browser console for errors in your tool function
- Add `console.log` in your tool to see what the API returns
- Verify your `outputSchema` matches what the tool actually returns
- Check the Network tab to see if the Spring Boot API is responding

### 5.3 "Connection refused" or network errors

```bash
# Check which services are running
curl http://localhost:3001/health    # Tambo API
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health  # Spring Boot
docker ps                            # PostgreSQL

# If Tambo API is down, restart it
cd ~/projects/tambo && npm run dev:cloud

# If PostgreSQL is down
docker compose --env-file docker.env up postgres -d
```

### 5.4 "Zod validation error"

This means the data returned by your tool doesn't match the `outputSchema`. Check:
- Are field names exactly right (case-sensitive)?
- Are number fields returning numbers (not strings)?
- Are optional fields marked with `.optional()` in the schema?

### 5.5 Reading Agent Reasoning

The Tambo API logs show what the agent is thinking. Look for lines like:

```
[Agent] User message: "show me no-shows"
[Agent] Selected tool: getNoShows
[Agent] Tool input: { organizationId: "org-123", date: "2026-02-16" }
[Agent] Tool output: { date: "...", patients: [...], totalScheduled: 12 }
[Agent] Selected component: NoShowAlert
[Agent] Streaming props...
```

This is invaluable for understanding why the agent made a particular choice.

## Part 6: Practice Exercise — Build a Component (45 min)

Now it's your turn. Build one of these components on your own:

### Option A: HealthCoachLeaderboard

A ranked table showing health coaches sorted by encounter completion rate.

**Hints:**
- Props: `coaches` array with name, completedCount, totalAssigned, completionRate, avgEngagementDelta
- Tool: calls `/api/dw/events` grouped by healthCoachId with completion stats
- Useful for: "Who's my top performing health coach?" or "Coach performance this month"

### Option B: DeviceComplianceCard

A summary card showing RPM device reading compliance.

**Hints:**
- Props: totalDevices, activeDevices, complianceRate, devicesNeedingAttention array
- Tool: calls `/api/dw/devices` with compliance filters
- Useful for: "How many devices are reporting?" or "Which devices need attention?"

### Option C: WeeklyTrendMiniChart

A small sparkline-style chart comparing this week vs. last week for a single metric.

**Hints:**
- Props: metricName, thisWeekValue, lastWeekValue, trend array, percentChange
- Tool: calls the relevant DW endpoint with two date ranges
- Useful for: "How are we doing compared to last week?" or "Enrollment trend"

**Steps to follow:**
1. Create the React component in `src/components/tambo-pms/`
2. Define the Zod schema and add it to `pmsComponents` in `pms-tambo.ts`
3. Create a tool in `pms-tools.ts` (use mock data if the API endpoint isn't ready)
4. Test with natural language queries in the sidebar
5. Commit your work on a feature branch

## Part 7: Development Workflow and Conventions

### 7.1 File Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── tambo-pms/              # All Tambo PMS components live here
│       ├── enrollment-dashboard.tsx
│       ├── encounter-table.tsx
│       ├── no-show-alert.tsx
│       ├── analytics-sidebar.tsx
│       └── pms-tambo-provider.tsx
├── lib/
│   ├── pms-tambo.ts            # Component registrations (schemas + descriptions)
│   └── pms-tools.ts            # Tool definitions (API calls)
```

### 7.2 Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Component file | kebab-case | `no-show-alert.tsx` |
| Component name | PascalCase | `NoShowAlert` |
| Tool name | camelCase | `getNoShows` |
| Tambo registration name | PascalCase (matches component) | `"NoShowAlert"` |

### 7.3 Writing Good Descriptions

The description is the most important part of the registration. It determines whether the agent picks your component/tool for a given query.

**Do:**
- List specific keywords users might say
- Explain what the component shows
- Mention the data source
- Be specific about when to use it vs. similar components

**Don't:**
- Write generic descriptions like "A chart component"
- Assume the agent knows domain terms — spell out "no-show means missed appointment"
- Leave descriptions shorter than 2 sentences

**Good example:**
```
"Displays patients who missed their appointments (no-shows) for a given day.
Shows patient names, appointment times, encounter types, and contact info.
Includes severity color coding based on no-show count. Use this when the user
asks about no-shows, missed appointments, or patients who didn't show up."
```

**Bad example:**
```
"Shows no-show data"
```

### 7.4 PR Checklist

When submitting a PR that adds a Tambo component:

- [ ] Component file created in `src/components/tambo-pms/`
- [ ] Component registered in `pms-tambo.ts` with Zod schema
- [ ] Description is detailed (2+ sentences, includes trigger keywords)
- [ ] All props have `.describe()` annotations
- [ ] Tool created in `pms-tools.ts` (or mock data with TODO comment)
- [ ] Tool `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` match actual data shapes
- [ ] Tested with at least 3 different natural language phrasings
- [ ] No PHI exposed in component descriptions or tool definitions
- [ ] TypeScript types pass (`npm run check-types`)

### 7.5 Security Reminders

- **Never put PHI in descriptions or schemas.** Descriptions go to the LLM. Only structural info (field names, types) should be in schemas.
- **All data flows through authenticated Spring Boot APIs.** The user's JWT is passed through and validated server-side.
- **The Tambo backend is self-hosted.** Conversation state stays in our PostgreSQL instance.
- **LLM API calls contain only:** the user's natural language query, component/tool schemas, and tool output. No raw patient records are sent to the LLM unless a tool returns them — design tools to return minimal, relevant data.
