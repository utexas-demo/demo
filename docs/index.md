## Specifications & Requirements

The PMS uses a **three-tier requirements decomposition**: System (SYS-REQ) → Domain (SUB-*) → Platform (SUB-*-BE/WEB/AND/AI). There are 13 system requirements, 50 domain requirements, and 100 platform requirements across 4 platforms. Domain requirements live in `specs/requirements/domain/` and platform requirements in `specs/requirements/platform/`.

- [System Specification](specs/system-spec.md) — System-level scope, context, subsystem decomposition, and platform codes
- [System Requirements (SYS-REQ)](specs/requirements/SYS-REQ.md) — 13 system-level requirements with platform annotations

### Domain Requirements
