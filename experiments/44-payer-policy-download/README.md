# Experiment 44: Payer Policy Download — Anti-VEGF PA Rule Library

Downloads publicly available medical policy documents from 6 major payers to build a structured prior authorization rule library for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections.

## Payers

| Payer | Type | Key Documents |
|-------|------|---------------|
| CMS Medicare Traditional | FFS | LCDs, NCDs, ASP pricing |
| UnitedHealthcare | MA | Medical policies, PA list, formulary |
| Aetna | MA | Clinical Policy Bulletins, precertification |
| BCBS of Texas | Commercial + MA | Medical policies, PA requirements |
| Humana | MA | Coverage policies, PA lookup |
| Cigna | MA | Coverage policies, EviCore guidelines |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pdfplumber pyyaml

# Download all payer policies
python download_policies.py

# Download specific payer(s)
python download_policies.py --payer cms_medicare uhc

# List configured payers
python download_policies.py --list

# Verify existing downloads
python download_policies.py --verify

# Extract structured rules from downloaded PDFs
python extract_rules.py

# View extraction summary
python extract_rules.py --summary
```

## Output Structure

```

## Manifest

Every download is tracked in `data/manifest.json` with:
- Source URL
- Download timestamp
- File size
- SHA-256 checksum
- Content type
- Status (success/failed)

Run `python download_policies.py --verify` to validate all files against the manifest.

## Rule Schema

Each rule represents one **payer × drug × diagnosis** combination. The extractor reads each downloaded PDF, checks if it mentions any target drugs (by HCPCS code, generic name, or brand name), and for each drug × diagnosis pair found, creates a rule object with evidence extracted via regex patterns.

### How Rules Are Generated

```
PDF document
  → text extraction (pdfplumber)
  → relevance check (mentions any target drug/procedure?)
  → pattern matching (PA required? step therapy? documentation? denial triggers?)
  → cross with drugs × diagnoses mentioned in the text
  → one rule per (payer, drug, diagnosis) combination
```

A single PDF that mentions 3 drugs and 2 diagnoses produces 6 rules. Each rule carries its own evidence lines — the specific text excerpts that matched the regex patterns.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `payer_id` | string | Config key for the payer (e.g., `uhc`, `aetna`, `cms_medicare`) |
| `payer_name` | string | Human-readable payer name from config |
| `drug_code` | string | HCPCS J-code for the drug (e.g., `J0178`). Set to `GENERIC` if the document discusses anti-VEGF agents without naming specific drugs |
| `drug_name` | string | Brand and generic name, formatted as `Brand (generic)` |
| `procedure_code` | string | CPT code if `67028` (intravitreal injection) appears in the document; empty string otherwise |
| `diagnosis_group` | string | One of: `wet_amd`, `dme` (diabetic macular edema), `rvo` (retinal vein occlusion), `geographic_atrophy`, or `general_ophthalmology` (fallback when no specific ICD-10 codes are found) |
| `covered_icd10` | string[] | ICD-10 codes found in the document that match the diagnosis group's patterns. For `general_ophthalmology`, includes up to 20 ICD-10 codes found anywhere in the text |
| `pa_required` | bool | `true` if any PA-related pattern matched (e.g., "prior authorization required", "precertification required") |
| `pa_evidence` | string[] | Up to 5 text lines that matched PA patterns — the raw evidence supporting `pa_required` |
| `step_therapy_required` | bool | `true` if step therapy patterns matched (e.g., "must try bevacizumab first", "preferred agent") |
| `step_therapy_evidence` | string[] | Up to 5 text lines that matched step therapy patterns |
| `required_documentation` | string[] | Up to 10 unique text lines matching documentation patterns (e.g., "OCT within 30 days", "visual acuity", "letter of medical necessity") |
| `auth_duration_months` | int \| null | Number of months the authorization is valid, if found in text |
| `auth_max_injections` | int \| null | Maximum number of injections authorized per approval period, if found |
| `denial_triggers` | string[] | Up to 10 text lines matching denial patterns (e.g., "missing documentation", "expired authorization", "wrong diagnosis") |
| `hcpcs_codes_found` | string[] | All HCPCS J-codes found anywhere in the document (not just target drugs — useful for cross-referencing) |
| `policy_source_file` | string | Path to the PDF that this rule was extracted from |
| `policy_last_downloaded` | string | ISO date when the source PDF was last downloaded |
| `extraction_confidence` | string | `high` (2+ PA matches and 1+ step therapy match), `medium` (1+ PA match), or `low` (drug mentioned but no PA patterns matched) |

### How Fields Interact

- **`pa_required` ↔ `pa_evidence`**: `pa_required` is `true` when `pa_evidence` is non-empty. The evidence lines are the proof — if they look like false positives (e.g., PA text for a different drug), the rule's confidence is suspect.
- **`step_therapy_required` ↔ `step_therapy_evidence`**: Same relationship. Step therapy typically means the payer requires trying a cheaper drug (usually bevacizumab/Avastin) before approving the requested drug.
- **`extraction_confidence`**: Derived from the combination of `pa_evidence` and `step_therapy_evidence` counts. A `low` confidence rule means the drug was mentioned in the document but no PA-specific language was found near it — the rule still exists because the document is relevant, but the PA status is uncertain.
- **`diagnosis_group` ↔ `covered_icd10`**: The diagnosis group determines which ICD-10 pattern to filter by. When the extractor can't match specific diagnosis codes, it falls back to `general_ophthalmology` and includes all ICD-10 codes found in the document (up to 20).
- **`hcpcs_codes_found` vs `drug_code`**: `drug_code` is the specific drug this rule is about. `hcpcs_codes_found` is every J-code in the entire document — useful for seeing what else the policy covers alongside the target drug.
- **`auth_duration_months` ↔ `auth_max_injections`**: These are independent — a policy might authorize 6 months or 12 injections (whichever comes first). Both can be `null` if the document doesn't specify limits.

## Rebuild on New Machine

```bash
cd experiments/44-payer-policy-download
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pdfplumber pyyaml
python download_policies.py
python extract_rules.py
```

## Notes

- Some payer portals use JavaScript rendering — if pages download as empty HTML, use Playwright fallback
- Only publicly accessible documents are downloaded (no login-walled content)
- Policy documents should be re-downloaded monthly to catch updates
- The `data/` directory is gitignored; use `download_policies.py` to rebuild
